        <h2>Aina Mardhiah</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Aina mardhiah, one of thousands people who came from Ipoh, Perak.
        Baking has been my favourite things to do since i was a kid when i first eating my mom's
      chocolate cake. My first ever bake was chocolate chip cookies which i made using my mom's personal recipe.
    It was kind of The Famous Amos cookies, but tastes better. Since then, I have tried a lot more recipes
  that I learned from youtube and then I started making my own recipe after many failure attempt to create one. Then I met my team, D' Foodie,
   and we started to make simple recipes together as a hobby. Since then, we decided to open our own bakery shop although at first,
   we were not known by many people, but through our hardwork, we made D' Foodie into a well-known bakery shop among the locals.

    <h2>Nureen Batrisyia Balqis</h2>
    <p>Hellooo! I'm Nureen and I'm 20 year old. Currently studying in IIUM Gombak. So basically, I started baking after
      I saw lots of cute and tasty desserts on the Internet. Plusss, I love my mom's pastries and desserts too so I join
      my mom when she wants to bake something whenever I'm free. Though nowadays, I'm the one who bake the cookies or cakes for my family,
      my skills still could not be compared to my mom. I wonder what she put in there :D

<h3>The D'Foodie Story</h3>
<div class="story">
  Our starting point was not so smooth as people expected. We started off
  by baking some recipes from Google, Tiktok, & Instagram. After few years of following people's recipe,
  we started baking with our own recipes for fun and that was the starting point for us
  to think that we should develop a website using our homemade recipes soon.
  However, there were so many try & errors, giveups, and thoughts that maybe we had put our hopes too high.
  Through thick and thin, we finally made our first ever own recipe, a simple croissant.
  Since then, we made many more recipes and that was how D'Foodie was ebstalished.
  We built our own website on 21th November 2021 and our recipes start to get shared more among people
  around January 2022 and it was a great chance to be able
   to share our recipes with a lot of people. If you have any interesting recipes,
   <a href="recipeform.html" id="contact">contact us here</a> to submit one, and stand a chance to get your recipe to be featured on our website!
