      Chocolate cake is made with chocolate. It can also include other ingredients.
      These include fudge, vanilla creme, and other sweeteners. The history of
      chocolate cake goes back  to the 17th century when cocoa powder
      from the Americas was added to traditional cake recipes.
      In 1828, Coenraad van Houten of the Netherlands developed a mechanical
     extraction method  for extracting the fat from cacao liquor resulting
      in cacao butter and the partly  defatted cacao,  a compacted mass of
      solids that could be sold as it was "rock cacao" or ground into powder.
     The processes transformed chocolate from an exclusive luxury to an
     inexpensive daily snack.  A process for making silkier and smoother
     chocolate called conching was developed in 1879 by Rodolphe Lindt
     and made it easier to bake with chocolate, as it amalgamates smoothly and
     completely with cake batters. From 1890 to 1900, chocolate recipes
     were mostly for chocolate drinks, and its presence in cakes was only
      in fillings and glazes. In 1886, American cooks began adding chocolate
       to the cake batter, to make the first chocolate cakes in the US.

     In the U.S."chocolate decadence" cakes were popular in the 1980s; in the 1990s,
     single-serving molten chocolate cakes with liquid chocolate centers and infused
     chocolates with exotic flavors such as tea, curry, red pepper, passion fruit,
     and champagne were popular. Chocolate lounges and artisanal chocolate makers were popular
     in the 2000s. Rich, flourless, all-but-flourless chocolate cakes are
    "now standard in the modern pâtisserie," according to The New Taste of Chocolate in 2001.</div>
